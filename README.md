## Modeling and Simulation of Aerosol Flow in a Classroom Environment with Mobile Sensors
#### Team Members: Zixin Ma, Jiali Qian, Yidan Wang 
#### Mentors: Professor Tauhidur Rahman, PhD Tanjid Hasan Tonmoy

### Overview:
In light of the significant impact of COVID-19, it is crucial for individuals to assess the safety of indoor environments effectively and accurately. Although there are existing apps that monitor factors such as air quality and temperature, they fail to consider the concentrations of respiratory aerosols or other contaminants. To address this issue, we aim to develop a mobile application that utilizes built-in sensor data  and machine learning models to simulate aerosol flow and forecast the safety of indoor environments. Our app will not only serve as a tool for assessing COVID-19 safety, but also for other illnesses and purposes.
